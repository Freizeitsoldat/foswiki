*This extension will *not* work with Foswiki 1.1.x or earlier.*

This extension (currently) implements search operations (query and text search) using [[http://www.sqlite.org/][SQLite]], the popular lightweight implementation of an SQL relational database. It uses the special cache hooks recently added to the Foswiki RCS store to cache topics in the database, and executes %<nop>SEARCH= using SQL. We get over the fact that SQL does not implement all the query search features of Foswiki by _hoisting_ SQL expressions out of the Foswiki search statements, leaving behind only those parts of the expression that SQL can't handle.

*If you are experienced with SQLite and / or other SQL DMBS, you are invited with open arms to contribute to the further development of this extension.*

The extension is currently classed as experimental because it has a number of problems:
   1 The SQL schema (and the query generator) are (probably) sub-optimal, and require extensive tuning.
   1 SQLite is fine for small data, but does not scale well. Large data requires use of an industrial strength DB (such as MySQL) instead.

The longer term goal is to implement a full back-end store using an SQL RDBMS, rather than just a simple cache as at present.

Mapping to another DB *should* be as simple as setting up a different
DSN, but life is never that simple. Not all DBs imlpement the REGEXP
operator, for example. Please go ahead and try, though.
