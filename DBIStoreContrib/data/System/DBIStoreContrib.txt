%TOC%

This extension (currently) implements search operations (query and text search) using the Perl DBI interface to SQL databases. It has been tested with [[http://www.sqlite.org/][SQLite]], the popular lightweight implementation of an SQL relational database, and to a lesser extent with [[][MySQL]].

We get over the fact that SQL does not implement all the query search features of Foswiki by _hoisting_ SQL expressions out of the Foswiki search statements, leaving behind only those parts of the expression that SQL can't handle.

The extension is currently classed as experimental because the SQL schema (and the query generator) are (probably) sub-optimal, and require extensive tuning.

The longer term goal is to implement a full back-end store using an SQL RDBMS, rather than just a simple cache as at present.

Mapping to another DBMS *should* be as simple as setting up a different
DSN (but life is rarely that simple. Not all DBs implement the REGEXP
operator, for example). Please go ahead and try, though.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%
   * Go to =configure= and:
      1 Set a DSN for the contrib in the 'Extensions' section (the default is for sqlite3),
      1 *For Foswiki > 1.1*, add =Foswiki::Contrib::DBIStoreContrib::Listener= to the ={Store}{Listeners}= *EXPERT* setting in the 'Store' section, *or*
      1 *For Foswiki 1.1 and earlier*, you should enable the integrated =DBIStorePlugin=.
      1 Select =Foswiki::Store::SearchAlgorithms::DBIStoreContrib= for the ={Store}{SearchAlgorithm}= setting.
      1 Select =Foswiki::Store::QueryAlgorithms::DBIStoreContrib= for the ={Store}{QueryAlgorithm}= *EXPERT* setting
