%TOC%

To support international character sets, Foswiki is configured with a
={Site}{CharSet}=, which sets the encoding used with
character strings. This determines the range of characters (glyphs) that can be
used in wiki topics, and for naming wiki topics and attachments.

(To understand what this means on a technical level, read
Foswiki:Development.UnderstandingEncodings)

The default encoding used by Foswiki is iso-8859-1, which is a
reasonable choice for many western languages.  However there are many
other languages that have characters that do not appear in this charset
(for example, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi). If you didn't consider the
possibility, when you set up your wiki, that your users might want to
include text using these characters, then you may well have accepted
the default. Unfortunately once you have chosen a
={Site}{CharSet}, it becomes impossible to use other character sets in
topics, as the charset is associated with the entire wiki site, and not
with individual topics.
 
There is one global standard encoding, called UTF-8, which supports
most character sets known in the world today. Ideally all Foswikis
would use UTF-8, in which case this problem would go away. For this to
work, there has to be some way to convert a wiki from and existing
={Site}{CharSet}= to UTF-8.

That's what this module does. Even if you don't have an immediate need
for non-western character sets this is worth doing, as Foswiki is moving
in the direction of standardising on UTF-8 for all data.
 
Note that this module converts all the histories of all your topics,
as well as the latest version of the topic. It also maps all web,
topic and attachment names. It does not, however, touch the content of
attachments.

---++ Installation
%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Usage
The convertor is used from the command-line on your wiki server (if you do not have access to the command line then we are sorry, but there is currently no way to use the conversion).

To use the convertor, =cd= to the =tools= directory in your installation and =perl convert_charset.pl=. The script has built-in help information.
