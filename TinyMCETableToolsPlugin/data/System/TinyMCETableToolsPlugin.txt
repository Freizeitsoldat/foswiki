---+ !TinyMCE Table Tools Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Plugin Preferences
Provides the [[TinyMCEPlugin][TinyMCE]] plugin =tabletools=, which should be enabled by listing it in the [[TinyMCEPlugin#Settings][ =TINYMCEPLUGIN_ADDITIONAL_MCEPLUGINS= ]] preference setting. It provides the following toolbar buttons:

    * =tabletoolscopy= - copy the currently selected table's contents to clipboard as tab-delimited data for pasting into spreadsheet programs such as MS Excel, OpenOffice etc.
    * =tabletoolsclean= - clean the currently selected table of any decorative attributes that would make it fail html2tml conversion. Toolbar icon state uses a sad-face if the selected table would not successfully convert to TML. 

The TinyMCEPlugin toolbar may be customised to include these buttons by listing them in the [[TinyMCEPlugin#Settings][ =TINYMCEPLUGIN_ADDITIONAL_BUTTONS1=, =TINYMCEPLUGIN_ADDITIONAL_BUTTONS2= ]], etc. preference settings.

Alternatively, %TOPIC% will automatically:
   * Add itself to the =TINYMCEPLUGIN_ADDITIONAL_PLUGINS= variable
      * Inhibit this behaviour by setting =TINYMCEPLUGIN_NO_AUTOLOAD = on=
   * Insert the toolbar buttons to the right of the =tablecontrols= button, wherever that appears among the =TINYMCEPLUGIN_BUTTONSn= and =TINYMCEPLUGIN_ADDITIONAL_BUTTONSn= variables.  
      * Inhibit this behaviour by setting =TINYMCETABLETOOLSPLUGIN_NO_AUTOTOOLBAR= on=
